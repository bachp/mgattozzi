<div class="front-subtitle"> Thoughts and musings from a functional programmer who drinks too much
coffee.</div>

Welcome! This site contains a variety of things including how to get in
contact with me, my resume, who I am, as well as a articles I have written
regarding technical topics usually related to Rust or Haskell.

If you're a recruiter I'm currently not looking for a job right now, but
I encourage you to get in contact with me if I ever do decide I'm
looking for a new job.
