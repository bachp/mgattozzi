My Personal Blog written with Rust!

I've begun work on porting over the code from
[mgattozzi.github.io]("https://github.com/mgattozzi/mgattozzi.github.io")
so that I can serve files from a personal server and domain eventually.
I didn't want to use jekyll and thought it would be fun to write my own
server to do it. This code right now renders posts automatically in
\_posts then places them in their own folder under site which is where
everything is served from.

Currently a WIP that could eventually turn into it's own Rust based
static site generator.
