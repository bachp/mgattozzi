My name is Michael Gattozzi. I'm finishing up my CS Undergrad at Umass Boston
this year. I work at a Financial Tech Startup called Elsen, Inc. where I get to write
Haskell in production! In my spare time I write a lot Rust code and
lately I've been bridging the gap between the two languages. I also have the
pleasure of serving in the MA National Guard where I get to work on
radios and computers in the S6 of the Battalion I work at.

I love tweaking my laptop setup in order to get it just the way
I want it too. Currently I use Arch Linux with bspwm as my window manager. You can find
my configuration of it [here](https://github.com/mgattozzi/bspwm_config)
and you can find my dotfile configurations
[here](https://github.com/mgattozzi/dotfiles).

Current Tech interests include:

- Rust
- Haskell
- Machine Learning
- Fin Tech
- Metasploit
- Block Chain Technology

When I'm not working on code I enjoy looking for new delicious coffee
places in Boston, catching up on newer TV and Anime shows as well as
playing newer video games when I get the chance (the current ones being
The Witcher 3 and Civilization 6). I also enjoy taking photographs in my
spare time and particularly enjoy macro photography.

Here's an example of one from my trip to Europe during the summer of
2015:
