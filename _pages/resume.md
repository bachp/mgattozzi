While attending Drexel I realized that I was passionate
about computers and made the switch to Computer Science
and back to my hometown of Boston to pursue that degree
instead.

# Articles
----------------------
## Schemers
### An Introduction to Rust
An ongoing series for newcomers to the Rust Language through
a project where they build a Scheme Interpreter. It's goal is to make
the language accessible by explaining harder concepts in terms that
anyone can understand and through hands on experience. Exercises and
answers are provided to guide the user along and to let them try out
features as they're introduced.

# Notable Personal Projects
----------------------
## Curryrs
### A library for easy Rust and Haskell FFI
The goal of this library is to make using Rust in Haskell and Haskell in
Rust effortless. It came about after much personal frustration over trying to
get it to work and the lack of any documentation.

## Alchemist
### A Unix Platform Agnostic Installation Tool
Often I found that many code bases provide instructions for needed
tools for specific platforms, usually Ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows, but
neglect other distributions. The goal of Alchemist is to make that
problem go away. With a database of package names it translates them
into the ones for your platform and installs them with your system
package manager.
